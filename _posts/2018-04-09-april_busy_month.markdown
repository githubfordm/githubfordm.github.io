This April gonna be a busy month!<br>
Well, in my to-do list...<br><br>
* Revise Pickeep to Ver 2.0(with additional features)
* Finish graduation project(HYME)
* Do opencv projects
* Study for mid-term
* KEEP LEARNING!

<br>..I hope I can bear these things, well I must.<br>
Hopefully, May 'may' not be tougher than this month.. I guess?
